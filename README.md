thingspeak-jqmobile-form
========================

A jQuery Mobile web form for submitting data to a Thingspeak instance.  Why should things have all the fun?

How it works
------------

Your Thingspeak URL, channel and write API are stored locally on your device using HTML5 localStorage.  If these values are not initially set, you will be prompted to fill them out on first page load.  This allows you to use ANY Thingspeak install, either from Thingspeak.com or your local service, without having to modify the page code.
